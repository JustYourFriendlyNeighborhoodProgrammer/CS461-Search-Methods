# Program 1: Route Finding with Various Search Methods

Welcome to the first program of the semester! In this assignment, we'll be exploring route-finding using multiple algorithms, comparing their performance. Below are the details and guidelines for implementing and presenting your solution.

## Task Overview

Your task involves implementing different search methods to find a route between two cities given a list of cities and their adjacencies. The major methods to implement include undirected (blind) brute-force approaches, breadth-first search, depth-first search, ID-DFS search, best-first search, and A* search.

## Instructions

1. **Implementation Approach:**
    - Rapidly implement versions of each major method discussed in Chapter 2.
    - You can utilize existing implementations, but ensure to document the prompts used if a generative model is employed.

2. **Programming Details:**
    - Choose C, C++, Python, C#, or Java for your implementation.
    - You'll be provided with two data files: a list of cities with their coordinates and a CSV file with adjacent town pairs.

3. **Program Features:**
    - Ask the user for starting and ending towns from the provided database.
    - Allow users to select a search method for finding a route.
    - Print the route, if found, from origin to destination.
    - Optionally, visualize the generated route as a map.

4. **Additional Requirements:**
    - Measure and print the total time needed to find the route (including a time-out).
    - Calculate and display the total distance between cities on the selected route.
    - Optionally, determine the total memory used to find the solution.

5. **Iteration and Comparison:**
    - Return to the search method selection to allow users to compare different methods.
  
6. **Submission:**
    - Provide a link to your repository (GitHub, Replit, Jupiter, GitLab, or a zip file from your IDE).
    - Create a 3-5 minute video demonstrating and explaining your code and functionality.
    - Discuss observations regarding the execution time differences for each method.
    - Highlight how each function finds the route.

**Note:** The provided database is limited, excluding many real-world roads for simplicity.
